## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
womens_basketball_2324 <- read_csv("data/wbb_rosters_2023_24.csv")
```

We might need to calculate average height using total inches since that column is in a number format already. The only other solution I can think of is converting the height into a decimal where 5.01 means 5 foot 1, etc.

I don't know what the variable count means and can't find what that variable definition it in the big GitHub file.

The 2023-2024 roster data set alone has 13,907 rows and 31 columns with lots of data already cleaned including the players' home state, country, position, etc.

```{r}
womens_basketball_2324 <- womens_basketball_2324 |>
  mutate(ncaa_id = as.character(ncaa_id))
```

1.  **What states produced the most NCAA recruits for the 2023-2024 season? Trying to add census data to then calculate rate per 1,000.**

```{r}

```

2.  **What schools produced the most NCAA recruits for the 2023-24 season? Are they mostly public or private?**

```{r}
wbb_high_school <- womens_basketball_2324 |>
  drop_na(hs_clean) |>
  group_by(hs_clean) |>
  summarize(count = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(count)) |>
  top_n(10)
```

```{r}
#Trying to string together hs name clean with the city and state so we group by each unique high school.
womens_basketball_2324 <- womens_basketball_2324 |>
  drop_na(hs_clean) |>
  mutate(hs_and_state = paste(hs_clean, " -", hometown_clean))
```

```{r}
 wbb_high_school_clean <- womens_basketball_2324 |>
  drop_na(hs_and_state) |>
  group_by(hs_and_state) |>
  summarize(count = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(count)) |>
  top_n(10)
```
